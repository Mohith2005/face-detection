# face-detection
This project detects and matches faces from images using a reference photo. It scans a folder, compares faces with a threshold, and saves matched images to an output folder. Built with `face_recognition` and `OpenCV`, it supports batch processing, error logging, and is ideal for face verification, photo sorting, or security tasks.
